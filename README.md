# Registration-Web-Application
Registration form submits to server, data is saved to database file; read & query database.

Application is a work in progress:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THIS IS NOT SECURE. Don't try to use it for anything important; I just did this as a learning exercise in node js.

Instructions:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. open up command line terminal, & start up your server (doesn't really matter what you use) in the same directory as the project, and navigate to the url.

2. enter data into the form and submit.

3. the server processes the data on the backend and saves it to a database file. Even after the server goes down, the data remains. :)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I will be working on SQL Server Integration Pipeline soon as well. Thanks for checking out my app!

##Form data is now posting to the server and saving to the database file.

<input name='userInput'id='input' type="text"></input>

const userInput = document.querySelector('input');


##Upgraded form to include first name, last name, phone number

##we are now logging the response body in a string format

##database operations unnaffected. All systems available.
